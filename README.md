Pauses the in-game time when all players leave the server, then continues it when a player joins the server.

### What is this for?

This datapack can be applied for many reasons, some of which are:

- You have a modded server with a seasons mod, and you don't want the seasons to progress when everyone is offline.
- You want to pause the time in your server and keep it where it was before everyone left.

### Setting up this datapack

1. Download the release for your Minecraft version.
2. Select your world, click "Edit", then "Open world folder".
3. Put the `.zip` file in the `/datapacks` folder.
4. Join your world.

### Setting up this datapack for servers
